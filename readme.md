## Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a modern and easy to use order management system with order placement form as well. You can track progress in our TODO list :smile: 

More information coming soon. Please note that this project is currently **work in progress** and you shouldn't use it in production!

## Setup

Note: The following instructions are for developers. Setup instructions for beginners will be provided later.

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Prisma CLI](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-cli-and-configuration/using-the-prisma-cli-alx4/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

1. Clone this repository 
2. Enter the `backend` directory
3. Run `docker-compose up -d` and then `prisma deploy`
4. Run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start the GraphQL Yoga server
5. Enter the `frontend` directory
6. Edit the `settings.js` file and include your Auth0's client id & domain
7. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies
8. Now run `npm run dev` to start the application in the development mode

- You can access the GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:4000/`
- You can access the order placement form at `http://localhost:3000` and the admin dashboard at `http://localhost:3000/admin` (you will need to login to see the list of orders)
- To build the application in the production mode, just run `npm run build`

  * [x] Ability to delete orders
  * [ ] Production-ready Frontend (styles etc.)
* [x]  Working Backend

**Project Page**
